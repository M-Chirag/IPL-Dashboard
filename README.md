# A WebApp dashboard to display data of the Indian Premier League (IPL) from 2008-2021 editions

Used Spring batch and ReactJS


To run the webapp, just start the Spring boot application and hit the end point localhost:8080/, this will start the React App as well.

This happens because we have mapped the endpoint with the springboot app by adding  all the frontend artifacts in the src/main/resources/ public folder. The public folder gets loaded in the browser upon starting the springboot app.
